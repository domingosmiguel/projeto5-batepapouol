# **Project 5: BatePapoUol**

This project was made with the aim of creating the front-end of a working chat site and integrating it with the Driven back-end. I tried to keep things simple while delivering the best app I could with my current knowledge.

## **Exercised Contents**:

-    OOJS using json data
-    API integration
-    DOM methods through vanilla Javascript (querySelector, addEventListener)
-    SASS to substitute CSS
-    Axios for integration with back-end
-    Responsiveness
-    Javascript methods (setInterval, clearInterval)
-    Handling CSS properties (transform, transition)
-    Basic Javascript (functions, forEach, some) and best practices

## **Results**:

I'm happy with the result, it was full of firsts. I was able to deliver more than what was requested in both layout and functionality and it was really cool trying to use JSON to store data for the first time. I also used SCSS for the first time and felt that my code became much clearer. Lastly, it was the first time I integrated back and front end and it was really fun and challenging.

To show the result, the application was posted on [Github Pages](https://domingosmiguel.github.io/projeto5-batepapouol/)! It is primarily designed for mobile devices, but it is very flexible and can be easily used on desktop.

## **How To Run**:

-    Clone repository
-    Open index.html in your browser

## **Comments**:

With good time management, I did the whole project keeping in mind some practices that I found interesting, such as:

-    All the html you see is dynamically generated, there is not a single line written in the html file
-    Better organization of functions, with better-defined and optimized scopes
-    Use of variables and SASS for better code organization
